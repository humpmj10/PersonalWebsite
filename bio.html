		<h1>Michael's Biography</h1>
		<p>
			This is my biography page. I was born in Bremerton, WA in 1983. I was raised in a large family of six. I have two brothers and one sister. My childhood took place in Washington state. I attended elementry, middle school and high school in Lynnwood, WA. All three schools were named meadowdale. 
			My childhood wasn't too exciting living in a suburban neighborhood. However, I did meet lifetime friends in high school and we had good times. We still keep in touch to this day. In high school
			I played football as a linebacker for the varsity team. We weren't exactly <q>good</q>, but I had lots of fun playing. I also ran track and was awarded the freshmen of the year award.

			Eventually living in constant rain got to me, so I decided to move to sunny Arizona. My parents had moved there about a year before I did. I visited and enjoyed the sun and warm weather. I packed all my stuff in my Acura, which included my dog Athena, and drove 32 hours straight to Tucson. My friend Eric was a good friend and drove with me. Without energy drinks and no-doze, we probally wouldn't have made it. When I arrived in Tucson I got a job at GEICO insurance as a claims adjuster. I worked there for five years and saved up money to attend the University of Arizona. I completed my degree in Computer Science and graduated magna cum laude. I'm currently searching for a job as a software engineer.
